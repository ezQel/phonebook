Contacts managements appplication

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

# Getting Started

1. Install `nvm` then `node` & `npm`: `brew install nvm && nvm install`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Recommended `node` setup

In order to have more consistent builds, use a strict `node` and `npm` version as defined in the `package.json` `engines` field and `.nvmrc` file. It is recommended to install `node` via `nvm` for easy node version management. Automatic `node` version switching can be installed for [`zsh`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#zsh) or [`bash`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#bash) using `nvm`.
